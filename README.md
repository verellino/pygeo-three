# Pygeo Three.js
> Collaboration Dashboard to manipulate 3D Objects

The objectives and final deliverable requirements for this project are as follows: Create a modeling page for Pygeo based on vuetify (Vue.js), three.js, and Python (in accordance with company standards). The page should display geometric shapes, allow basic operations like rotation, and be capable of showing Pygeo elements such as points and faces. The modeling page should encompass all Pygeo-related API interactions and support adjustments of points and faces to control the geometry. This project will not have set milestones during its course, but communication will occur on a weekly basis to confirm progress and details.
